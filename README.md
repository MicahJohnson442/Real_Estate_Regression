# Real_Estate_Regression
In this project, I was to predict the selling price of a residential property. 
This would depend on several factors such as the property age, availability of local amenities, geographical coordinates, and housing price-per-unit.
These would be the features for the model as I will use a dataset of real estate sales transactions to predict the price-per-unit of a property based on its features. 
The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.  

I was tasked to train a regression model that had to achieve the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) you can achieve (which must be less than 7) when evaluated against a test subset of data. 
A regression model is a simple, common, and highly useful data analysis technique, often colloquially referred to as "fitting a line." 
In its simplest form, regression fits a straight line between a one variable (feature) and another (label). 
In more complicated forms, regression can find non-linear relationships between a single label and multiple features.
